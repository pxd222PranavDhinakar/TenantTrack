# frontend

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- npm (version X.X.X)

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. Create a `.env` file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   This command will create a new `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.

5. Update the `.env` file:
   Open the `.env` file in a text editor and provide the necessary environment variable values. For example:
   ```
   VUE_APP_API_URL=http://example.com/api
   VUE_APP_SOME_KEY=abcdefg
   ```

   Make sure to replace the placeholder values with the actual values required for your project.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server and run the Vue application, use the following command:
```
npm run serve
```

This command will compile the application and start a development server. You can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080` (or the appropriate URL displayed in the console).

The development server supports hot-reloading, which means that any changes you make to the source code will be automatically reflected in the browser without the need to manually refresh the page.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:
```
npm run build
```

This command will compile and minify the application files, generating an optimized bundle ready for deployment. The production-ready files will be located in the `dist` directory.

## Linting and Code Formatting

To lint and fix any code formatting issues, use the following command:
```
npm run lint
```

This command will run the linter and automatically fix any fixable issues in the source code.

## Additional Configuration

For more advanced configuration options, please refer to the [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/) provided by Vue CLI.
